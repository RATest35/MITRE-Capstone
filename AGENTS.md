## Coding Style
- Follow single responsible principal when you write code, create files and directries. BUT, do NOT split code to too many functions.
- Implement code according to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Write short docstrings.
- Do not create deep nesting.
- All function arguments and return values must have type annotations.
- Keep the number of functions and methods low.
- Write code with as few conditional branches as possible, keeping the flow consistent and easy to read.
- Use styles that keep code as simple as possible. For example, use list comprehensions like `[x for x in y]` to write concise and clear code.
- Insert appropriate empty lines between processing blocks so each logical unit is easy to identify.
- Do not write fallback logic, as it adds unnecessary complexity to the code.
